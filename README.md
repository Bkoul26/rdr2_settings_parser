# RDR2 Settings parser
We all looked forward to the release of cowboy-em-up **Red Dead Redemption 2** on PC. The game has _a lot_ of graphics settings options, and has proven to be quite a beast to get running well. The built-in presets are system-dependent, which makes comparing settings and performance between systems a bit harder.

I made a little tool to parse the game's settings file (system.xml) into a nice text block to share settings with in online discussions
